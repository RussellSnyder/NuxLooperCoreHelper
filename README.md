# NuxLooperCoreHelper
Automatting the task of renaming audio files to load into NuxLooperCore pedal

The file structure should be

audioFiles
-> Folders named after track
    ->scene1.wav
    ->scene2.wav
    ->scenen.wav

the ouput folder will contain a set map (showing where your scenes are loaded) and a folder ready to be loaded onto the Nux pedal via micro USB connection

Now you can change one track or add a track and you dont have to spend an hour loading everything in again!  Woohoo!
